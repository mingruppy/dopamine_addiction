            <h1>DOPAMINE_ADDICTION</h1>
            <p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter secreted into the nerve circuits responsible for motivation and pleasure. Dopamine poisoning is a phenomenon in which dopamine, which is involved in reward and pleasure, becomes increasingly insensitive, and finds more stimulating and stronger pleasure. </p>
